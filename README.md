# Electron Salesforce Import Application

This is just a fun project to check how to work with Electron.
The idea behind is to create GUI for https://github.com/mkesicki/sfdc-import
Do not use it on production :)

TODOs:
- Any validation of data might be nice to have :)
- Add Drag & Drop for file
- Add some spinner etc to show that work is in progress
- Think about some progress bar
- If you see any login data in code there are for trailhead ...
- Block the form(s) when spinner is .... spinning :)
- Proper/better way to load windows/files
- Yes, design I know :)
- Improve search event, now it works on change event which is not most user friendly
- Add user's a chance to change mind during mapping of fields
- Set Batch size correctly related to number of child objects
- Maybe minimum number of rows to parse in threads should be a config param
