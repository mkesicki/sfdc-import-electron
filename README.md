# Electron Salesforce Import Application

This is just a fun project to check how to work with Electron.
The idea behind is to create GUI for https://github.com/mkesicki/sfdc-import
Do not use it on production :)

TODOs:
Any validation of data might be nice to have :)
Add Drag & Drop for file
Add some spinner etc to show that work is in progress
Think about some progress bar
If you see any login data in code there are for trailhead ...
Block the form(s) when spinner is .... spinning :)
Proper/better way to load windows/files
Yes, design I know
